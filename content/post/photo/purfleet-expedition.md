London was ~32C yesterday, and good weather like this is perfect for my photo expeditions. This time, I wanted to knock the Purfleet Riverfront/Rainham Marshes/whatever-the-fuck-it's-called. I thought it was rather underwhelming, but I've had it on my bucket list for a long time, and it's FREE!

Turns out it was more interesting than expected. Great views of the Dartford Crossing, boats passing by the Thames, and other interesting sights. It's outdone by other expeditions that are more vertical and further away from London, but not too bad. One big downside thought was that instead of exploring the marshes, I planned a route from Purfleet to Rainham station. A route that, unbeknownst to me, includes walking near a *landfill site*. Disgusting.

On a side note, I updated my MacBook to OS beta 15.0, so I reinstalled everything - including Lightroom. Now it makes my laptop hotter and keeps pushing AI bullshit onto me, and I think the auto function is worse. Fucking hell, maybe I should move onto Lightroom CC...
