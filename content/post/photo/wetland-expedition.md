[As promised previously](../photo-expeditions), I went another expedition after seeing the sun out; this time. While listening to the beautiful *Wave Race 64* soundtrack, I spent a day at the [WWT London Wetland Centre](https://www.wwt.org.uk/wetland-centres/london). It's hard to call it an 'expedition' when it's still in London, but I recently bought a 70-300mm telephoto lenses, and by God I was going to use it.

Here's the results:

Wildlife photography is pretty fun, a lot more unique than my usual landscapes. You can see more [on my Flickr](https://flickr.com/blackwavesofenergy/) as usual.
