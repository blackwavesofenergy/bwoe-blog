Last weekend was Comic Con day, and I know what that meant - lots and lots of cosplay photography to practice my portraits. Last year I went on a Friday, but today I decided to go on a Saturday. Big mistake. The venue was absolutely packed, completely crowded with cosplayers. You'd think this would be a good thing, but since Saturday opens very early (9am), I didn't get much sleep. The lack of sleep to wake up for priority opening means less energy (and nerves...) to ask for photos, plus the over-excess of cosplayers making my head spin. Had I stuck to the Friday date, I would have more energy and less cosplayers, meaning a shorter checklist and more chances to check.

Oh well. Here's some photos of my results:
