When the sun and its sweet, sweet natural light is out, I feel an urge to go on a photo expedition. What is a photo expedition, you may ask? It's a trip outside of my home town of London, in the rural English countryside, where I spend a day alone taking pictures and listening to my happiest music. With no browser on my phone, there is no need to worry about the state of the world - the outdoors and its photogenicity are all that matters. Examples of such expeditions include:

My most recent expedition as of today was to *Merstham and Reigate*, along the North Downs Way Circular Walk. It was around 3-4 hours of hiking, in which I ruined my shoes, scraped my arm and got lost numerous times, but it was well worth it, as the results show:

The only problem with these expeditions is that I can only do so many. I need the natural light, and while I am willing to harm my body for such rewards, it can only toil for so long before I need rest. And when I rest, I face constant fears of the black waves. Not only that, but the best places for such expeditions are under select criteria: empty (I need the tranquility of solitude - even one jogger interrupts), having walkable areas with no country roads (I hate walking on the road shoulder), have plenty of interesting things to shoot (I'm kind of sick of the usual green landscapes), etc. And unfortunately, that list is dwindling by the day, at least affordably - fuck British train fees!

Where and when shall my next expedition occur? Hopefully, tomorrow (25 June as of this post), but everything needs to line up perfectly.
