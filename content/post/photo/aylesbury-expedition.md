On 30 July, I went on another photography expedition. I wanted to go to Hastings the day before, but I was late because of some stupid shenanigans back home. £20 down the drain... I could have tried again, but this time I went to Aylesbury - specifically, walking from Wendover station to Little Kimble station.

I thought my trip was sabotaged, since my planned route was blocked by HS2 construction work. Funny, since HS2 is never fucking happening. But I eventually found a detour and the walk was incredibly satisfying just as I had hoped for.

I did however, notice that my camera/lenses were a bit misaligned. My viewfinder is blurry, noticeable chromatic aberration, etc... I'll get it fixed some time, but I don't have time right now since I need to take the maximum advantage of summer; all this beautiful natural light can't go to waste.

If the weather is right, my next expedition should be on the 5th. We'll see.
