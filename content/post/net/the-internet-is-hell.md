God bless [Cold Turkey Blocker](https://getcoldturkey.com/). What would I do without you? Well, live in a more honest world, an honestly shittier world. In my blocklist called 'Digital Alprazolam' which lasts for the end of time and cannot be deactivated without uninstalling Cold Turkey. I have blocked 500+ sites, including popular social media psyop tools like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and the like. If I need to apply for a job with LinkedIn, then I'll stay unemployed, thank you very much.

I also have another blocklist, called 'Digital Methylphenidate'. This blocks **all** websites with a few exceptions, ones I use for work, like GitHub, Adobe, etc. This blocklist I only initiate for a few hours when I need to get work done without any distractions. 

I'm not going to go into detail why blocking websites is so good here, but I do advise you give Cold Turkey and other website blockers a try if you're fed up with the e-dystopia like I am. There are many, but none offer the strength and versatility that Cold Turkey does.
