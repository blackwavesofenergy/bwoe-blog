In 2017-2018 I had an account on Letterboxd and a film buff phase. It was a cool site for finding out film recommendations and reviews. This combined with RYM's film search function netted me a lot of favourite films.

I deleted my account, along with all my other social media, in early-mid 2019. But now that I'm out of my mental breakdown, I was wondering if I should go back to it.
