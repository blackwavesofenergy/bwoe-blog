In an [earlier post](../the-internet-is-hell.md), I explained how I used Cold Turkey Blocker to keep me sane. Today I'll go over the blocklists I use and how I cycle between them for maximum efficiency and sanity-preservation.

- Digital Duloxetine
This blocklist is permanent, 24/7, until Cold Turkey is uninstalled (in other words, a system reset). It consists of of over 500 websites, ranging from garbage clickbait sites to pornography to central social media platforms to _. There is no way to access these sites, so I can't access them whatsoever. Good!

- Digital Benzodiazepine
This blocklist is enabled every so often, when I want to take a break. It blocks EVERY website except around ~100, mostly entertainment sites like YouTube. This is activated for a few days - never more than a week. By the time it's over, I should have the mental energy to access the rest of the net - except those on *Digital Duloxetine*.

- Digital Methylphenidate
This is my no nonsense, get-to-work blocklist. It's essentially a more hardcore version of Digital Benzodiazepine, shutting off access to all websites except a whitelist, except this time the number of sites are even smaller - from 1 to about 12 depending on what I'm working on.

Important note to self: always activate the blocklist in the night, not in the morning! You don't want to see something upsetting first thing in the morning and have to deal with a black wave for the rest of the day...
