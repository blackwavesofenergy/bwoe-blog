I found a way to disable my blocklists, and I used it to browse some YT videos to see the comments/responses.

/Never again./

Never. Ever. Again.

The worst part about it is, even in an innocent comment thread - like in a highly liked comment praising something you like or something you support, you click the ‘show more comments’ thread with the _ knowing full well that there’ll be something negative. That there’ll be something awful, that there’ll be a comment that tells you that the thing you like or support or *are* are garbage, and so on. Like nothing is safe. And when you click it, thinking maybe, just maybe, this time it’ll be okay? But of course, it never is. Your pessimism is always correct.

Same, of course, with sorting by new.
