One day, I decided to check OpenCritic, a Metacritic-like video game rating aggregation site, for the _ hunt for hidden gems. I discovered two highly-rated games that I've never heard before. One was 'Vernal Edge', a unique but pretty boring Metroidvania. The other, though, is a contender for one of the greatest pieces of interactive media I've ever had the luxury of experiencing.

*Videoverse* is part-social simulation, part-visual novel. Designed as a love letter to old video game message boards and social platforms, *Videoverse* revolves around the titular social network, an amalgation of GameSpy and Miiverse.
