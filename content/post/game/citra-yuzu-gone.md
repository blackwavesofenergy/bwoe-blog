Well, damn. It was [literally just yesterday](../flatpak-emu-problems) that I uploaded about emulation problems, but now we have a different type of emulation problem: Citra and Yuzu are gone.

This is relevant because I was talking about a fatal bug for Dolphin, which also affected Citra (and RPCS3). The fix for Citra was uploaded LITERALLY YESTERDAY, meaning had the Citra/Yuzu team (the same dev team) hadn't updated it, the last version of Citra on Flathub would be forever unbootable.

Shit like this is not kind to my OCD.
