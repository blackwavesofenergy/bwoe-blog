Day 40 of the Great Gaming Fatigue of 2024. The impact of Tango Gameworks's closing continues to ripple. The only game I 'play' is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which I'm going to sell today because I don't want to fucking play it anymore, it makes me too mad. I'm also selling Dragon Quest XI S on the Nintendo Switch. A game that means a lot to me - it helped get me through my 2019 breakdown and COVID - but I just need to get out of my library to make a quick buck. It's sad... wait, no it's not, it's just a video game.

I don't want to hear the discourse of new games. I don't want to calculate the hype, I don't want to see the critical reception, I don't want to see the commercial reception, I don't want to get involved in any of it. But the urge to do so is strong. God damn it...

Not much to comment on but vent my frustrations. Sorry.
