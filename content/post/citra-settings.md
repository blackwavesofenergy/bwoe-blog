Playing 3DS games on a single screen can be tough. The vertical form factor of the 3DS makes gaming quite the challenge when emulating. So, these are my preferred Citra settings. Feel free to use or improve them.

# Picross 3D
Bottom screen should be the main. Use a mouse and keyboard for this one, with d-pad and L buttons being used for controls.
