It’s been two months since I’ve updated the blog. I have a lot on my mind, so let me just compose my thoughts like this.

- I had a period of depression. I can’t really articulate how bad it was (still is?), so I'll talk about it another time; it was the worst I've felt in such a long time.

- I’m not really quite sure what to do with the future. I don’t have much faith for 2025; I feel like all avenues for self-improvement have been exhausted. Seriously, what can I do? Sometimes I think I should do a reviewing site to keep my fingertips warm, or expand my social media, or compose music, but then the thought is crushed some way or another. So I’m seriously conflicted. I need to figure out something before the end of the year, seriously.

- One resolution I do have, though, is to detach myself from the gaming community for at least six months. Gaming might be a passion, but with years ticking down to my 30’s, it can’t be my sole passion. All these days logging and updating my backlog, updating my journal, worrying about completion times, dates, etc... all of it just added up to a more bloated backlog and less games completed than last year by quite a margin (55 in 2023 vs 23 in 2024 - and most of those were fucking picross games). It doesn’t help that 2024 has been one piece of shit for gaming. [I’ve spoken about this before](../../game/still-fatigued/), and while it’s mellowed out a bit, I don’t see how next year can miraculously become better; if it does, then I don’t have to be there for it. 

- I’ll still be playing games, but I’m going to reduce my backlog to about 50 and focus on those for the year. Not buying any new games except for the must-haves (Switch 2, GTA6, etc) and I’m not going to follow any announcements or news. It’s going to be a de-gameification.

- I’m currently getting my camera repaired; I think I need to do many more expeditions next year - I really slacked off this year. Doesn’t help I barely left my city, let alone my country throughout the entire year. But where do I go?

- I need to bite the AI bullet and at least try GitHub Copilot. I hate the 2020s, I hate brainrot, I hate AI, I hate everything about it, but lagging behind isn't worth it.

I'll see you in a bit.
