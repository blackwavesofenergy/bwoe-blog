> I am the anti-psychotic,

Enough of this. Enough of these _ thoughts. During showers. During family meetings. During my expeditions. During any attempts of media-consumption-cum-escapism. Enough of it. Yet there's no drug that seems to take them away. The fluoxetine does shit. The alprazolam does shit. I don't care what it does anymore. I don't care if it destroys my _ cortex. I'll light up a blunt, snort some _, smoke crack rocks, do anything to stop these thoughts. I've had these for years and years. Enough. WHEN WILL IT BE ENOUGH?
