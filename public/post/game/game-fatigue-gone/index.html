        <h1>Game Fatigue Ends <span>16 August, 2024</span></h1>
    </div>
    
    <p>Sometime around 2 July, my gaming fatigue disappeared. The Steam Summer sale and an increase of mood allowed me to get into my favourite hobby again. Moreover, <a href="../the-closure-of-tango">while I wrote about how demoralised I was over Tango Gameworks&rsquo;s closure</a>, a factor in the fatigue, some great news happened since - they have been bought and re-opened by Krafton (a South Korean game studio) and brought the Hi-Fi Rush IP with them! Now the spark has really come back. Here is what I&rsquo;ve been playing since:</p>
<h1 id="shin-megami-tensei-v---vengeance">Shin Megami Tensei V - Vengeance</h1>
<p>I was a bit hasty on purchasing this. The original SMT5, while very fun, was a disappointment - unfinished story, awful performance due to it being a Switch exclusive, and baffling gameplay decisions like level scaling and locking bossfights behind level caps really ruined what could have been a great game. This re-release, now on Steam and other platforms, promised to solve that with its new Chaos of Vengeance story, but I thought that wasn&rsquo;t enough before going into it. I&rsquo;ll give Atlus credit - Chaos of Vengeance is <em>much</em> better than the original pitiful excuse for a story. The game is also well optimised - 90FPS on Steam Deck on high settings. You can tell that the years spent trying to get this damn game running on a Switch resulted in a super efficient game engine, one that really shines on actually decent hardware.</p>
<p>The gameplay is still as good as ever, although the amount of QoL additions was perhaps a bit excessive - I&rsquo;m finding this instalment MUCH easier than the original. SMT5 was already far more streamlined compared to its predecessors like <em>Nocturne</em>, so I&rsquo;m not sure if they had to go so far in this direction. Still, I&rsquo;ve almost finished and I&rsquo;m satisfied with the efforts Atlus has gone to improve it.</p>
<h1 id="persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</h1>
<p>Another Atlus game. What can I say, these games are truly addictive - I love Atlus RPG combat so much that I never lose interest in it. <em>Persona 3</em> is a game I have good memories with, having played <em>Portable</em> (both male and female routes) ages ago back on the good ol&rsquo; PSP. Having been introduced to the genre thanks to EarthBound, I wanted something on the same wavelength - a modern say setting, no random encounters, etc. And while it was a lot more different and &lsquo;anime&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s still a special game to me. But enough about my nostalgia, what about <em>Reload</em>? I was also hesitant on picking it up because I didn&rsquo;t want to replay a game I&rsquo;ve already beaten twice, especially considering that the FES content is pay-walled behind a season pass expansion coming out next month. None the less, I bit the bullet. Playing at the same time as <em>SMT5V</em>, the actual combat can&rsquo;t compare - it&rsquo;s way to easy and slow-paced - but the presentation of Reload is outstanding (as I expected). I&rsquo;m enjoying this one, but I think I&rsquo;ll stick to an 8/10 unless the endgame - and Episode Aigis - can blow my expectations.</p>
<h1 id="outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</h1>
<p>As well as buying these new games, I decided to explore my backlog. <em>Outer Wilds</em> is a game that is endlessly praised by every corner of the gaming community, but usually accompanied by an important recommendation - &ldquo;go into it blind&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did - the only thing I knew about <em>Outer Wilds</em> is that it had space exploration and a time loop. And acoustic guitars. And that the guy from <em>Heroes</em> produced it. I&rsquo;m only a few hours in, but I&rsquo;m definitely interested in what I&rsquo;m playing. So far, it feels like <em>2001 - A Space Odyssey</em> in video game form, complete with mysterious reality-altering monoliths, but I need to delve in further to see the narrative curveballs that I&rsquo;ve been hyped up about. Also, the lack of voice acting is a bummer, considering how immersive it is in every other aspect.</p>
<h1 id="street-fighter-6-and-guilty-gear-strive">Street Fighter 6 and Guilty Gear Strive</h1>
<p>Of course, I just couldn&rsquo;t leave out my favourite game genre out of this. My 75 hours of SF6 in 2023 is now 110 - I just couldn&rsquo;t pass Akuma (and soon, Terry and Mai) up. It&rsquo;s still peak, although I&rsquo;m still not in Diamond yet. As for <em>Strive</em>, I&rsquo;m not quite sure why I got back into, as I&rsquo;ve always thought it was a step down from Xrd. I guess I wanted to try out the plenty of DLC that came out since I last picked it up. I was actually quite surprised to see all the mechanics they introduced, even updating movesets and adding game modes. They also fixed the online! Netcode was always great, but Strive&rsquo;s actual connectivity was dogshit last I played it - lobbies straight up didn&rsquo;t work. It&rsquo;s much better, although I&rsquo;m noticing more dropped matches than before - that might be because of Linux/Proton, though.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m happy. There is nothing quite like fighting games, and. I also want to get back into <em>Tekken 8</em>, but its 97GB install size (and increasing) always daunts me.</p>
<h1 id="baldurs-gate-3">Baldur&rsquo;s Gate 3</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, having never played D&amp;D and not jiving with isometric-style WRPGs (unless you count <em>Disco Elysium</em>), I was a bit lost with this one. But I&rsquo;ll definitely go back to it. How can I not, everybody sucks BG3 off to no end.</p>
