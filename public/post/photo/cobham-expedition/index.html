        <h1>Cobham Expedition <span>18 September, 2024</span></h1>
    </div>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s midday. I&rsquo;m tired as shit, I woke up at 4am, I&rsquo;ve spending the past few days tiring myself out trying to rearrange my house to accommodate family, and I&rsquo;m on a train to Stoke &amp; Cobham, on the shitty South Western Railway. For a train that takes you to posh-arse Surrey, it sure is a disaster of a train service. No air conditioning, old and dirty carriages, not even a tray on the seats. But there&rsquo;s a short spell of sun - a week of natural light - and I need to make the most of it before the autumn clouds destroy what&rsquo;s left of the summer. (Of course, it&rsquo;s not like photography has a time limit, but I got to wait for autumn foliage to make the most of the season.)</p>
<p>This is my first photo expedition since Aylesbury, which was on <em>July</em>. That may not seem that far away, but I can&rsquo;t afford to go rusty. Two months is essentially an eternity if you want to keep your skills sharp in a field like this. And since I&rsquo;m already quite knackered, I decided to go for a relatively painless trip to Cobham, and explore the Painshill gardens.</p>

<p>And it turns out&hellip; that was <em>not</em> a painless trip to Cobham. First of all, it takes two miles to get to Painshill, and when you do finally get there, it&rsquo;s much larger than I thought. I only ended up covering around a third of the park before my feet couldn&rsquo;t endure no more - then I had to walk the way back to the train station. Clearly, I severely underestimated how rusty I was. At least I got some good cardio?</p>
<p>Another regret, though, was that I seemed to have forgotten how to take low-light photos. At least, take them well. I took some photos of the Crystal Grotto, but as you can see by the de-noising artifacts, I really could have improved.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been ages since I took photos like these; again, this expedition has been one big wake up call. But it could also just be the physical exhaustion - it was the last resting point before I headed back. I never got to visit The Waterwheel, the River Mole, the Five Arch Bridge&hellip;</p>
