        <h1>September Thoughts <span>13 September, 2024</span></h1>
    </div>
    
    <p>Another much needed post. Once again, miscellaneous troubles cause hesitancy to update. Stress, anxiety and insomnia has come back full force, derailing any plans I had for the month. The end of summer and colder weather has also obstructed my usual photography opportunities. It&rsquo;s been over a month since I&rsquo;ve picked up my camera, and longer still since my last expedition in Aylesbury.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m realising how important those photo expeditions were for my mental health. Without them, that feeling is more and more alien. If there&rsquo;s anything I have to a hobby that I inherently love, it&rsquo;s that. I don&rsquo;t know why and how photography became such an important part of my regimen.</p>
<p>Of course, the other hobby is video games. After spending much of the year bickering and complaining about gamer fatigue, I&rsquo;ve been on quite the roll:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/U7h6Wpp.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In particular, <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> and <em>Outer Wilds</em> was quite the one-two punch. Both games are surprisingly similar in that they explore the theme death - both thematically and through gameplay - and while I&rsquo;d like to write more about them, I think it&rsquo;s a conversation for another time.</p>
<p>This reignition of passion for gaming has made me want to write more about games in general. I&rsquo;ve tested the waters with <a href="https://www.backloggd.com/u/bwoe/review/1896429/">a lengthy review of <em>Capcom vs. SNK 2</em> on Backloggd</a>, but writing reviews by itself is challenging. With games that take well over 10 hours, it can be difficult to write as succinctly as say, a forty-minute album or two-hour film. Sometimes I have major thoughts on what to write about when playing the game, but after the credits roll they&rsquo;re long forgotten - resulting in the common feeling of staring at a blank word document, not knowing what to write. It makes me feel like I&rsquo;m not cut out for writing sometimes.</p>
<p>For instance, I have a draft for a review of <em>Videoverse</em> saved, but an in-depth review would need a huge introspective on pre-social media internet and online gaming forum culture in order to really convey what I mean. One day, I swear&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for today. I have a work programme soon, so I may be busy once again.</p>
