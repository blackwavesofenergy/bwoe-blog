      <description>So, I had a week where I essentially had no internet apart from a few crucial sites after I decided to mess around with Cold Turkey Blocker.&#xA;After the blocklist was finally disabled, I thought I would feel _. It was a boring week, filled with anxiety _.&#xA;But now, I just feel numb.&#xA;Not just because of the bad news and _ discourse, but because it made me feel some sort of way.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s midday. I&amp;rsquo;m tired as shit, I woke up at 4am, I&amp;rsquo;ve spending the past few days tiring myself out trying to rearrange my house to accommodate family, and I&amp;rsquo;m on a train to Stoke &amp;amp; Cobham, on the shitty South Western Railway. For a train that takes you to posh-arse Surrey, it sure is a disaster of a train service. No air conditioning, old and dirty carriages, not even a tray on the seats.</description>

      <description>I found a way to disable my blocklists, and I used it to browse some YT videos to see the comments/responses.&#xA;/Never again./&#xA;Never. Ever. Again.&#xA;The worst part about it is, even in an innocent comment thread - like in a highly liked comment praising something you like or something you support, you click the ‘show more comments’ thread with the _ knowing full well that there’ll be something negative.</description>

      <description>Another much needed post. Once again, miscellaneous troubles cause hesitancy to update. Stress, anxiety and insomnia has come back full force, derailing any plans I had for the month. The end of summer and colder weather has also obstructed my usual photography opportunities. It&amp;rsquo;s been over a month since I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up my camera, and longer still since my last expedition in Aylesbury.&#xA;Now I&amp;rsquo;m realising how important those photo expeditions were for my mental health.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t been in a proper photography expedition since Aylesbury, and the reason is quite embarrassing, but I&amp;rsquo;ll say it upfront; I haven&amp;rsquo;t had hot water in my house for over TWO WEEKS. Fortunately it&amp;rsquo;s summer, but that also means no hot showers. I like to wake up super early (before morning rush hour) and then travel to do my expeditions, which involves hours of long exploratory walks; I can&amp;rsquo;t do that with no showers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been &amp;lsquo;away&amp;rsquo; for a while. Okay, it&amp;rsquo;s only been two weeks since my last blog post, but a lot has happened. Anxiety over the news and family situations has resulted in me relapsing in a reclusive state, doing nothing but lying in my bed playing video games. But hey, at least I&amp;rsquo;m playing video games for once!&#xA;Because of this, I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone on an &amp;rsquo;expedition&amp;rsquo; like I promised, but I did go on a quick stroll to capture the sunrise one day while listening to the newly shadow-dropped Parannoul album.</description>

      <description>Sometime around 2 July, my gaming fatigue disappeared. The Steam Summer sale and an increase of mood allowed me to get into my favourite hobby again. Moreover, while I wrote about how demoralised I was over Tango Gameworks&amp;rsquo;s closure, a factor in the fatigue, some great news happened since - they have been bought and re-opened by Krafton (a South Korean game studio) and brought the Hi-Fi Rush IP with them!</description>

      <description>On 30 July, I went on another photography expedition. I wanted to go to Hastings the day before, but I was late because of some stupid shenanigans back home. £20 down the drain&amp;hellip; I could have tried again, but this time I went to Aylesbury - specifically, walking from Wendover station to Little Kimble station.&#xA;I thought my trip was sabotaged, since my planned route was blocked by HS2 construction work.</description>

      <description>London was ~32C yesterday, and good weather like this is perfect for my photo expeditions. This time, I wanted to knock the Purfleet Riverfront/Rainham Marshes/whatever-the-fuck-it&amp;rsquo;s-called. I thought it was rather underwhelming, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had it on my bucket list for a long time, and it&amp;rsquo;s FREE!&#xA;Turns out it was more interesting than expected. Great views of the Dartford Crossing, boats passing by the Thames, and other interesting sights. It&amp;rsquo;s outdone by other expeditions that are more vertical and further away from London, but not too bad.</description>

      <description>I am the anti-psychotic,&#xA;Enough of this. Enough of these _ thoughts. During showers. During family meetings. During my expeditions. During any attempts of media-consumption-cum-escapism. Enough of it. Yet there&amp;rsquo;s no drug that seems to take them away. The fluoxetine does shit. The alprazolam does shit. I don&amp;rsquo;t care what it does anymore. I don&amp;rsquo;t care if it destroys my _ cortex. I&amp;rsquo;ll light up a blunt, snort some _, smoke crack rocks, do anything to stop these thoughts.</description>

      <description>As promised previously, I went another expedition after seeing the sun out; this time. While listening to the beautiful Wave Race 64 soundtrack, I spent a day at the WWT London Wetland Centre. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to call it an &amp;rsquo;expedition&amp;rsquo; when it&amp;rsquo;s still in London, but I recently bought a 70-300mm telephoto lenses, and by God I was going to use it.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s the results:&#xA;Wildlife photography is pretty fun, a lot more unique than my usual landscapes.</description>

      <description>A wise girl once said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mental illnesses are like horoscopes, you just look up symptoms that loosely fit your personality.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Fluoxetine, also known as Prozac, is an SSRI. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on-and-off it for a year and a half now. Consultant psychiatrist said it was for OCD. However, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to doubt them more and more now. On 60mg of fluoxetine, I see no improvement. Instead, I become unmotivated, and strangely violent.</description>

      <description>When the sun and its sweet, sweet natural light is out, I feel an urge to go on a photo expedition. What is a photo expedition, you may ask? It&amp;rsquo;s a trip outside of my home town of London, in the rural English countryside, where I spend a day alone taking pictures and listening to my happiest music. With no browser on my phone, there is no need to worry about the state of the world - the outdoors and its photogenicity are all that matters.</description>

      <description>Day 40 of the Great Gaming Fatigue of 2024. The impact of Tango Gameworks&amp;rsquo;s closing continues to ripple. The only game I &amp;lsquo;play&amp;rsquo; is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which I&amp;rsquo;m going to sell today because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to fucking play it anymore, it makes me too mad. I&amp;rsquo;m also selling Dragon Quest XI S on the Nintendo Switch. A game that means a lot to me - it helped get me through my 2019 breakdown and COVID - but I just need to get out of my library to make a quick buck.</description>

      <description>One day, I decided to check OpenCritic, a Metacritic-like video game rating aggregation site, for the _ hunt for hidden gems. I discovered two highly-rated games that I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard before. One was &amp;lsquo;Vernal Edge&amp;rsquo;, a unique but pretty boring Metroidvania. The other, though, is a contender for one of the greatest pieces of interactive media I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had the luxury of experiencing.&#xA;Videoverse is part-social simulation, part-visual novel. Designed as a love letter to old video game message boards and social platforms, Videoverse revolves around the titular social network, an amalgation of GameSpy and Miiverse.</description>

      <description>One of my biggest faults is that I worry way too much. I think a lot of that has to do with OCD, but after months and months of fluoxetine treatment, I think there&amp;rsquo;s something bigger at play. A lot of the time, my worries are realized. I worried in 2019 about the centralised Web and the existence of algorithmic radicalisation. In worried in 2020 about the impact of COVID. I worried in 2021 and 2022 about post-pandemic malaise, and that virulent populism will surge as a result of widespread vaccine controversy.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe this loathsome world.&#xA;While the blocklists I mentioned earlier are incredibly vital for trying to live day to day without the sense of near-apocalyptic dread, there is a certain flaw which I like to call&amp;hellip;&#xA;EXPLOITS I heard that some news of one of my favourite games getting downloadable content, but with the &amp;lsquo;Digital Benzodiazepine&amp;rsquo; blocklist added, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t learn anything about it on my main computer. I deleted the browser from my phone, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use that either.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated the blog in a while because I was sick for a while - aches and headaches all over. But today I feel normal. And of course, when there&amp;rsquo;s fever, there&amp;rsquo;s fever dreams. And last night&amp;rsquo;s fever dream was something else.&#xA;Basically, I was panicking because of university deadlines. I was thinking to myself, what if I repeat the year again? How can I be 20+ years and still in university?</description>

      <description>Last weekend was Comic Con day, and I know what that meant - lots and lots of cosplay photography to practice my portraits. Last year I went on a Friday, but today I decided to go on a Saturday. Big mistake. The venue was absolutely packed, completely crowded with cosplayers. You&amp;rsquo;d think this would be a good thing, but since Saturday opens very early (9am), I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much sleep. The lack of sleep to wake up for priority opening means less energy (and nerves&amp;hellip;) to ask for photos, plus the over-excess of cosplayers making my head spin.</description>

It consists of of over 500 websites, ranging from garbage clickbait sites to pornography to central social media platforms to news outlets and beyond.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about a week since my rant about the closure of Tango Gameworks, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten over it a bit, I&amp;rsquo;m still fatigued by gaming. With the announcement of the Switch successor, we&amp;rsquo;re inching towards a proper new generation of gaming, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to be excited. Constant layoffs and studio closures. Rising prices and a trend towards $70 games. Cheaper budget games taken hostage by the whims of what popular streamers decide to play.</description>

      <description>In early 2023, I felt like gaming wasn&amp;rsquo;t fun anymore. I knew it was a common fatigue though, and that there&amp;rsquo;ll be a game that I&amp;rsquo;ll play soon that would inject that fun and soul only the medium could provide. That happened when Hi-Fi Rush shadow dropped in January 2023. With its gorgeous Futurama-esque aesthetics and comedic tone and excellent reviews, I bought it and fell in love immediately. The catharsis of the character action and rhythm genres, joined at last in spectacular fashion.</description>

In my blocklist called &amp;lsquo;Digital Alprazolam&amp;rsquo; which lasts for the end of time and cannot be deactivated without uninstalling Cold Turkey. I have blocked 500+ sites, including popular social media psyop tools like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and the like. If I need to apply for a job with LinkedIn, then I&amp;rsquo;ll stay unemployed, thank you very much.</description>

      <description>Well, damn. It was literally just yesterday that I uploaded about emulation problems, but now we have a different type of emulation problem: Citra and Yuzu are gone.&#xA;This is relevant because I was talking about a fatal bug for Dolphin, which also affected Citra (and RPCS3). The fix for Citra was uploaded LITERALLY YESTERDAY, meaning had the Citra/Yuzu team (the same dev team) hadn&amp;rsquo;t updated it, the last version of Citra on Flathub would be forever unbootable.</description>

      <description>So recently, there was some bizarre emulation problems. The issue didn&amp;rsquo;t come with the Steam Deck, or EmuDeck, but with the emulators themselves, specifically the Flatpak version commonly used in Linux.&#xA;Dolphin, RPCS3, and Citra all were nonfunctional out of nowhere. Citra was quickly patched, but Dolphin and RPCS3 are still unable to boot as of this post. Booting them reveals no error message or dumped log. Booting them via CLI (i.</description>

      <description>Playing 3DS games on a single screen can be tough. The vertical form factor of the 3DS makes gaming quite the challenge when emulating. So, these are my preferred Citra settings. Feel free to use or improve them.&#xA;Picross 3D Main screen: bottom Other screen: small or disabled Use a mouse and keyboard for this one, with d-pad and L buttons being used for controls.
