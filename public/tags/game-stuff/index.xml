      <title>Game Fatigue Ends</title>

      <description>Sometime around 2 July, my gaming fatigue disappeared. The Steam Summer sale and an increase of mood allowed me to get into my favourite hobby again. Moreover, while I wrote about how demoralised I was over Tango Gameworks&amp;rsquo;s closure, a factor in the fatigue, some great news happened since - they have been bought and re-opened by Krafton (a South Korean game studio) and brought the Hi-Fi Rush IP with them!</description>

      <title>Game Fatigue Continues</title>

      <description>Day 40 of the Great Gaming Fatigue of 2024. The impact of Tango Gameworks&amp;rsquo;s closing continues to ripple. The only game I &amp;lsquo;play&amp;rsquo; is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which I&amp;rsquo;m going to sell today because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to fucking play it anymore, it makes me too mad. I&amp;rsquo;m also selling Dragon Quest XI S on the Nintendo Switch. A game that means a lot to me - it helped get me through my 2019 breakdown and COVID - but I just need to get out of my library to make a quick buck.</description>

      <title>Play Videoverse</title>

      <description>One day, I decided to check OpenCritic, a Metacritic-like video game rating aggregation site, for the _ hunt for hidden gems. I discovered two highly-rated games that I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard before. One was &amp;lsquo;Vernal Edge&amp;rsquo;, a unique but pretty boring Metroidvania. The other, though, is a contender for one of the greatest pieces of interactive media I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had the luxury of experiencing.&#xA;Videoverse is part-social simulation, part-visual novel. Designed as a love letter to old video game message boards and social platforms, Videoverse revolves around the titular social network, an amalgation of GameSpy and Miiverse.</description>

      <title>The Closure of Tango Gameworks</title>

      <description>In early 2023, I felt like gaming wasn&amp;rsquo;t fun anymore. I knew it was a common fatigue though, and that there&amp;rsquo;ll be a game that I&amp;rsquo;ll play soon that would inject that fun and soul only the medium could provide. That happened when Hi-Fi Rush shadow dropped in January 2023. With its gorgeous Futurama-esque aesthetics and comedic tone and excellent reviews, I bought it and fell in love immediately. The catharsis of the character action and rhythm genres, joined at last in spectacular fashion.</description>

      <title>Citra and Yuzu are gone</title>

      <description>Well, damn. It was literally just yesterday that I uploaded about emulation problems, but now we have a different type of emulation problem: Citra and Yuzu are gone.&#xA;This is relevant because I was talking about a fatal bug for Dolphin, which also affected Citra (and RPCS3). The fix for Citra was uploaded LITERALLY YESTERDAY, meaning had the Citra/Yuzu team (the same dev team) hadn&amp;rsquo;t updated it, the last version of Citra on Flathub would be forever unbootable.</description>

      <title>Flatpak Emu Problems of March 2024</title>

      <description>So recently, there was some bizarre emulation problems. The issue didn&amp;rsquo;t come with the Steam Deck, or EmuDeck, but with the emulators themselves, specifically the Flatpak version commonly used in Linux.&#xA;Dolphin, RPCS3, and Citra all were nonfunctional out of nowhere. Citra was quickly patched, but Dolphin and RPCS3 are still unable to boot as of this post. Booting them reveals no error message or dumped log. Booting them via CLI (i.</description>

      <title>Settings for Citra</title>

      <description>Playing 3DS games on a single screen can be tough. The vertical form factor of the 3DS makes gaming quite the challenge when emulating. So, these are my preferred Citra settings. Feel free to use or improve them.&#xA;Picross 3D Main screen: bottom Other screen: small or disabled Use a mouse and keyboard for this one, with d-pad and L buttons being used for controls. Other screen is not required.</description>
