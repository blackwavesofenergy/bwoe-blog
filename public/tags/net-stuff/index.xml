      <description>So, I had a week where I essentially had no internet apart from a few crucial sites after I decided to mess around with Cold Turkey Blocker.&#xA;After the blocklist was finally disabled, I thought I would feel _. It was a boring week, filled with anxiety _.&#xA;But now, I just feel numb.&#xA;Not just because of the bad news and _ discourse, but because it made me feel some sort of way.</description>

      <title>Blocklists Never Again</title>

      <description>I found a way to disable my blocklists, and I used it to browse some YT videos to see the comments/responses.&#xA;/Never again./&#xA;Never. Ever. Again.&#xA;The worst part about it is, even in an innocent comment thread - like in a highly liked comment praising something you like or something you support, you click the ‘show more comments’ thread with the _ knowing full well that there’ll be something negative.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe this loathsome world.&#xA;While the blocklists I mentioned earlier are incredibly vital for trying to live day to day without the sense of near-apocalyptic dread, there is a certain flaw which I like to call&amp;hellip;&#xA;EXPLOITS I heard that some news of one of my favourite games getting downloadable content, but with the &amp;lsquo;Digital Benzodiazepine&amp;rsquo; blocklist added, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t learn anything about it on my main computer. I deleted the browser from my phone, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t use that either.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post, I explained how I used Cold Turkey Blocker to keep me sane. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll go over the blocklists I use and how I cycle between them for maximum efficiency and sanity-preservation.&#xA;Digital Duloxetine This blocklist is permanent, 24/7, until Cold Turkey is uninstalled (in other words, a system reset). It consists of of over 500 websites, ranging from garbage clickbait sites to pornography to central social media platforms to news outlets and beyond.</description>

      <title>The Internet Is Hell</title>

      <description>God bless Cold Turkey Blocker. What would I do without you? Well, live in a more honest world, an honestly shittier world. In my blocklist called &amp;lsquo;Digital Alprazolam&amp;rsquo; which lasts for the end of time and cannot be deactivated without uninstalling Cold Turkey. I have blocked 500+ sites, including popular social media psyop tools like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and the like. If I need to apply for a job with LinkedIn, then I&amp;rsquo;ll stay unemployed, thank you very much.</description>
