      <description>&lt;p&gt;So in my now-deleted posts &lt;em&gt;The Internet is Hell&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;About My Blocklists&lt;/em&gt;, I explained a strategy that I was taking for the year: extreme isolation from the ebb and flow of the internet using Cold Turkey Blocker and a generous amount of browser extensions. I should also add that I installed browser extensions like uBlacklist to block search engine results, Shut Up to block comments, etc. Extreme measures, but measures that I thought would improve my mental health and distance me from the noise of the 2020s Information Age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
