      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been &amp;lsquo;away&amp;rsquo; for a while. Okay, it&amp;rsquo;s only been two weeks since my last blog post, but a lot has happened. Anxiety over the news and family situations has resulted in me relapsing in a reclusive state, doing nothing but lying in my bed playing video games. But hey, [at least I&amp;rsquo;m playing video games!]</description>

      <description>I am the anti-psychotic,&#xA;Enough of this. Enough of these _ thoughts. During showers. During family meetings. During my expeditions. During any attempts of media-consumption-cum-escapism. Enough of it. Yet there&amp;rsquo;s no drug that seems to take them away. The fluoxetine does shit. The alprazolam does shit. I don&amp;rsquo;t care what it does anymore. I don&amp;rsquo;t care if it destroys my _ cortex. I&amp;rsquo;ll light up a blunt, snort some _, smoke crack rocks, do anything to stop these thoughts.</description>

      <description>A wise girl once said:&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Mental illnesses are like horoscopes, you just look up symptoms that loosely fit your personality.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Fluoxetine, also known as Prozac, is an SSRI. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on-and-off it for a year and a half now. Consultant psychiatrist said it was for OCD. However, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to doubt them more and more now. On 60mg of fluoxetine, I see no improvement. Instead, I become unmotivated, and strangely violent.</description>

      <title>Worried Since 2019</title>

      <description>One of my biggest faults is that I worry way too much. I think a lot of that has to do with OCD, but after months and months of fluoxetine treatment, I think there&amp;rsquo;s something bigger at play. A lot of the time, my worries are realized. I worried in 2019 about the centralised Web and the existence of algorithmic radicalisation. In worried in 2020 about the impact of COVID. I worried in 2021 and 2022 about post-pandemic malaise, and that virulent populism will surge as a result of widespread vaccine controversy.</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated the blog in a while because I was sick for a while - aches and headaches all over. But today I feel normal. And of course, when there&amp;rsquo;s fever, there&amp;rsquo;s fever dreams. And last night&amp;rsquo;s fever dream was something else.&#xA;Basically, I was panicking because of university deadlines. I was thinking to myself, what if I repeat the year again? How can I be 20+ years and still in university?</description>

      <description>In the beginning of 2023, I brought a sparkling new Macbook Pro and a subscription to Day One, and started a blog - Magdi Battles the Black Waves. It was intended to last for a year, but I only managed to keep track until August.&#xA;This was intended not for entertainment, but to help me manage my life. bwoe stands for &amp;lsquo;Black Waves of Energy&amp;rsquo;. What are black waves of energy?</description>
