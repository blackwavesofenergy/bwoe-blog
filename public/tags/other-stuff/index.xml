      <title>Late Year Update - Been a While</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been two months since I’ve updated the blog. I have a lot on my mind, so let me just compose my thoughts like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a period of depression. I can’t really articulate how bad it was (still is?), so I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about it another time; it was the worst I&amp;rsquo;ve felt in such a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not really quite sure what to do with the future. I don’t have much faith for 2025; I feel like all avenues for self-improvement have been exhausted. Seriously, what can I do? Sometimes I think I should do a reviewing site to keep my fingertips warm, or expand my social media, or compose music, but then the thought is crushed some way or another. So I’m seriously conflicted. I need to figure out something before the end of the year, seriously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Barred From Expeditions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been in a proper photography expedition since &lt;a href=&#34;../aylesbury-expedition&#34;&gt;Aylesbury&lt;/a&gt;, and the reason is quite embarrassing, but I&amp;rsquo;ll say it upfront; I haven&amp;rsquo;t had hot water in my house for over TWO WEEKS.  Fortunately it&amp;rsquo;s summer, but that also means no hot showers. I like to wake up super early (before morning rush hour) and then travel to do my expeditions, which involves hours of long exploratory walks; I can&amp;rsquo;t do that with no showers. And my family is a little bit too far away to use theirs. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been kind of those people are extremely anxious about BO and layer themselves with deodorant, but this is just impossible. There are no more expeditions unless my landlord gets their shit together and fixes it. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;m being robbed of these finest summer months because of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Much Needed Update</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been &amp;lsquo;away&amp;rsquo; for a while. Okay, it&amp;rsquo;s only been two weeks since my last blog post, but a lot has happened. Anxiety over the news and family situations has resulted in me relapsing in a reclusive state, doing nothing but lying in my bed playing video games. But hey, &lt;a href=&#34;../../game/game-fatigue-gone/&#34;&gt;at least I&amp;rsquo;m playing video games for once!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I haven&amp;rsquo;t gone on an &amp;rsquo;expedition&amp;rsquo; like I promised, but I did go on a quick stroll to capture the sunrise one day while listening to the newly shadow-dropped Parannoul album. Didn&amp;rsquo;t get as many endorphins as I hoped, but I&amp;rsquo;m okay with the results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A wise girl once said:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mental illnesses are like horoscopes, you just look up symptoms that loosely fit your personality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fluoxetine, also known as Prozac, is an SSRI. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on-and-off it for a year and a half now. &lt;em&gt;Consultant&lt;/em&gt; psychiatrist said it was for OCD. However, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to doubt them more and more now. On 60mg of fluoxetine, I see no improvement. Instead, I become unmotivated, and strangely violent. I&amp;rsquo;ve had anger management issues in the past, but I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d have something like that until on this glorified placebo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Worried Since 2019</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/other/worried-since-2019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest faults is that I worry way too much. I think a lot of that has to do with OCD, but after months and months of fluoxetine treatment, I think there&amp;rsquo;s something bigger at play. A lot of the time, my worries are realized. I worried in 2019 about the centralised Web and the existence of algorithmic radicalisation. In worried in 2020 about the impact of COVID. I worried in 2021 and 2022 about post-pandemic malaise, and that virulent populism will surge as a result of widespread vaccine controversy. Haven&amp;rsquo;t many of these worries come true? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t the materialisation of these fears only fuel even stronger anxieties? It feels like a switch was turned on sometime around early 2019, like I switched it on, and all the suffering of the future could be prevented but I can&amp;rsquo;t do anything about it. This sense of helplessness makes me feel that my absence from both social media and real-life interactions is a form of cowardice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Phantom Pain</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/other/phantom-pain/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t updated the blog in a while because I was sick for a while - aches and headaches all over. But today I feel normal. And of course, when there&amp;rsquo;s fever, there&amp;rsquo;s fever dreams. And last night&amp;rsquo;s fever dream was something else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Basically, I was panicking because of university deadlines. I was thinking to myself, what if I repeat the year &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;? How can I be 20+ years and still in university? How many black waves do I have to suffer to achieve my education? I imagined the student debt piling up, receiving no honours by the end of the year due to poor performance and having my CVs shredded, the image of the campus being burned in my retinas for eternity, just a nightmare of educational bureaucracy suffocating me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
