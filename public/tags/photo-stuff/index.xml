      <title>Barred From Expeditions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been in a proper photography expedition since &lt;a href=&#34;../aylesbury-expedition&#34;&gt;Aylesbury&lt;/a&gt;, and the reason is quite embarrassing, but I&amp;rsquo;ll say it upfront; I haven&amp;rsquo;t had hot water in my house for over TWO WEEKS.  Fortunately it&amp;rsquo;s summer, but that also means no hot showers. I like to wake up super early (before morning rush hour) and then travel to do my expeditions, which involves hours of long exploratory walks; I can&amp;rsquo;t do that with no showers. And my family is a little bit too far away to use theirs. I&amp;rsquo;ve never been kind of those people are extremely anxious about BO and layer themselves with deodorant, but this is just impossible. There are no more expeditions unless my landlord gets their shit together and fixes it. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe I&amp;rsquo;m being robbed of these finest summer months because of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 30 July, I went on another photography expedition. I wanted to go to Hastings the day before, but I was late because of some stupid shenanigans back home. Â£20 down the drain&amp;hellip; I could have tried again, but this time I went to Aylesbury - specifically, walking from Wendover station to Little Kimble station.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought my trip was sabotaged, since my planned route was blocked by HS2 construction work. Funny, since HS2 is never fucking happening. But I eventually found a detour and the walk was incredibly satisfying just as I had hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;London was ~32C yesterday, and good weather like this is perfect for my photo expeditions. This time, I wanted to knock the Purfleet Riverfront/Rainham Marshes/whatever-the-fuck-it&amp;rsquo;s-called. I thought it was rather underwhelming, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had it on my bucket list for a long time, and it&amp;rsquo;s FREE!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turns out it was more interesting than expected. Great views of the Dartford Crossing, boats passing by the Thames, and other interesting sights. It&amp;rsquo;s outdone by other expeditions that are more vertical and further away from London, but not too bad. One big downside thought was that instead of exploring the marshes, I planned a route from Purfleet to Rainham station. A route that, unbeknownst to me, includes walking near a &lt;em&gt;landfill site&lt;/em&gt;. Disgusting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../photo-expeditions&#34;&gt;As promised previously&lt;/a&gt;, I went another expedition after seeing the sun out; this time. While listening to the beautiful &lt;em&gt;Wave Race 64&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack, I spent a day at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wwt.org.uk/wetland-centres/london&#34;&gt;WWT London Wetland Centre&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to call it an &amp;rsquo;expedition&amp;rsquo; when it&amp;rsquo;s still in London, but I recently bought a 70-300mm telephoto lenses, and by God I was going to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the results:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53817946788_e9d1ea1296_c_d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53818035704_d05dc69c93_c_d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53832119177_b515339d8b_c_d.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wildlife photography is pretty fun, a lot more unique than my usual landscapes.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the sun and its sweet, sweet natural light is out, I feel an urge to go on a photo expedition. What is a photo expedition, you may ask? It&amp;rsquo;s a trip outside of my home town of London, in the rural English countryside, where I spend a day alone taking pictures and listening to my happiest music. With no browser on my phone, there is no need to worry about the state of the world - the outdoors and its photogenicity are all that matters. Examples of such expeditions include:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Photography at the London MCM Expo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was Comic Con day, and I know what that meant - lots and lots of cosplay photography to practice my portraits. Last year I went on a Friday, but today I decided to go on a Saturday. Big mistake. The venue was absolutely packed, completely crowded with cosplayers. You&amp;rsquo;d think this would be a good thing, but since Saturday opens very early (9am), I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much sleep. The lack of sleep to wake up for priority opening means less energy (and nerves&amp;hellip;) to ask for photos, plus the over-excess of cosplayers making my head spin. Had I stuck to the Friday date, I would have more energy and less cosplayers, meaning a shorter checklist and more chances to check.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
