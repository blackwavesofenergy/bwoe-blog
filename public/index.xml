      <description>Last weekend was Comic Con day, and I know what that meant - lots and lots of cosplay photography to practice my portraits. Last year I went on a Friday, but today I decided to go on a Saturday. Big mistake. The venue was absolutely packed, completely crowded with cosplayers. You&amp;rsquo;d think this would be a good thing, but since Saturday opens very early (9am), I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much sleep. The lack of sleep to wake up for priority opening means less energy (and nerves&amp;hellip;) to ask for photos, plus the over-excess of cosplayers making my head spin.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post, I explained how I used Cold Turkey Blocker to keep me sane. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll go over the blocklists I use and how I cycle between them for maximum efficiency and sanity-preservation.&#xA;Digital Duloxetine This blocklist is permanent, 24/7, until Cold Turkey is uninstalled (in other words, a system reset). It consists of of over 500 websites, ranging from garbage clickbait sites to pornography to central social media platforms to news outlets and beyond.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about a week since my rant about the closure of Tango Gameworks, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten over it a bit, I&amp;rsquo;m still fatigued by gaming. With the announcement of the Switch successor, we&amp;rsquo;re inching towards a proper new generation of gaming, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to be excited. Constant layoffs and studio closures. Rising prices and a trend towards $70 games. Cheaper budget games taken hostage by the whims of what popular streamers decide to play.</description>

      <title>The Closure of Tango Gameworks</title>

      <description>In early 2023, I felt like gaming wasn&amp;rsquo;t fun anymore. I knew it was a common fatigue though, and that there&amp;rsquo;ll be a game that I&amp;rsquo;ll play soon that would inject that fun and soul only the medium could provide. That happened when Hi-Fi Rush shadow dropped in January 2023. With its gorgeous Futurama-esque aesthetics and comedic tone and excellent reviews, I bought it and fell in love immediately. The catharsis of the character action and rhythm genres, joined at last in spectacular fashion.</description>

      <description>God bless Cold Turkey Blocker. What would I do without you? Well, live in a more honest world, an honestly shittier world. In my blocklist called &amp;lsquo;Digital Alprazolam&amp;rsquo; which lasts for the end of time and cannot be deactivated without uninstalling Cold Turkey. I have blocked 500+ sites, including popular social media psyop tools like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and the like. If I need to apply for a job with LinkedIn, then I&amp;rsquo;ll stay unemployed, thank you very much.</description>

      <title>Citra and Yuzu are gone</title>

      <description>Well, damn. It was literally just yesterday that I uploaded about emulation problems, but now we have a different type of emulation problem: Citra and Yuzu are gone.&#xA;This is relevant because I was talking about a fatal bug for Dolphin, which also affected Citra (and RPCS3). The fix for Citra was uploaded LITERALLY YESTERDAY, meaning had the Citra/Yuzu team (the same dev team) hadn&amp;rsquo;t updated it, the last version of Citra on Flathub would be forever unbootable.</description>

      <title>Flatpak Emu Problems of March 2024</title>

      <description>So recently, there was some bizarre emulation problems. The issue didn&amp;rsquo;t come with the Steam Deck, or EmuDeck, but with the emulators themselves, specifically the Flatpak version commonly used in Linux.&#xA;Dolphin, RPCS3, and Citra all were nonfunctional out of nowhere. Citra was quickly patched, but Dolphin and RPCS3 are still unable to boot as of this post. Booting them reveals no error message or dumped log. Booting them via CLI (i.</description>

      <title>Settings for Citra</title>

      <description>Playing 3DS games on a single screen can be tough. The vertical form factor of the 3DS makes gaming quite the challenge when emulating. So, these are my preferred Citra settings. Feel free to use or improve them.&#xA;Picross 3D Main screen: bottom Other screen: small or disabled Use a mouse and keyboard for this one, with d-pad and L buttons being used for controls. Other screen is not required.</description>
